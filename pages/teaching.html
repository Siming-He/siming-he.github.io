<p>
<ul>
  <li>I counsel undergraduate researchers regarding research opportunities, faculty mentors, and grants.</li>
  <li>I mentor 20 1st and 2nd year students interested in doing computer science, robotics, and statistics research. I
    make weekly
    research talk lists to inform them about talks on campus in their interest areas.</li>
  <li>I design and conduct annual Python Programming for Research Workshops to introduce Python and common Python
    packages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resident Advisor</h3>
<i>Kings Court English College House (2023 Fall - Present)</i>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>As a resident advisor in a first-year studentsâ€™ dorm, I counsel my residents on various aspects of academic and
    residential
    life and support them through the challenges of first-year college life.</li>
  <li>I organize information sessions to connect residents with the abundant research resources on campus. Additionally,
    I host lunch sessions where faculty members join residents for conversations spanning academic, research, and daily
    life
    topics.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
<i>CIS 520 Machine Learning (2022 Fall)</i>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>I designed and led weekly recitations
    on machine learning concepts. To effectively support the students, I created online surveys for students to provide
    feedback.
    Based on the feedback, I improved my teaching style and aligned the focus of my recitation to their need.
    <a href="https://siming-he.github.io/assets/teaching/CIS520_POD.pdf" target="_blank">[Recitation Materials]</a>
  </li>

    detailed examples", "TA is always well-prepared, good timing", and "He reviews all the questions! Great TA".</li>

<h3>Founder</h3>
<i>Rykert After School Science Program (August 2018 - May 2020)</i>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>II organized the program to engage underprivileged middle school students in science experiments in a laboratory
    environment often beyond their regular access. I led the development of the curriculum, which focuses on hands-on
    experience. We designed intriguing experiments, including building electric wheels, building water rockets, and
    making
    slime (non-Newtonian fluid). I believe these experiments foster their understanding of physics concepts and inspire
    their
    curiosity in science.</li>
</ul>
