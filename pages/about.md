# **About Me**

Hello! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>

I am a senior pursuing dual degrees in <i>Computer Science</i> and <i>Statistics</i> with a minor in <i>Mathematics</i> at the Engineering School and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I am also an accelerating master in <i>Robotics</i> at the <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">GRASP Laboratory</a>. <br>


I am interested in the mathematical principles of embodied intelligence, including probability, information, and game theories. I am also passionate about incorporating the principles into computationally efficient robotics algorithms for broader impact in scientific discovery and environmental sustainability. I am currently a student researcher mentored by <a href="https://pratikac.github.io/" target="_blank">Pratik Chaudhari</a> and <a href="https://www.kumarrobotics.org/dr-vijay-kumar/" target="_blank">Vijay Kumar</a>. <br>
