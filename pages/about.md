# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br><br>
I am a junior studying <i>Computer and Information Science</i> and <i>Statistics</i> at the Engineering School and the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania respectively. My research interest is in the field of robotics and machine learning. I am currently a student researcher mentored by <a href="https://pratikac.github.io/" target="_blank">Pratik Chaudhari</a> in the <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">GRASP Robotics Laboratory</a>. I'm also working on projects in <a href="https://www.kumarrobotics.org/" target="_blank">Vijay Kumar Lab</a>.
<br><br>
I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an" target="_blank">Xi'an</a>, a city with long history, in north-central China. I stayed in Canada for three years during high school. 
<br><br>
I love swimming and am national second-level athlete in China. I also play tennis and soccer, and I was in my high school soccer and tennis varsity teams. Beside sports, I enjoy cooking, especially Sichuan and Shaanxi Cuisine. I also like reading random books during my free time.
