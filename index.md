# Research
I enable robots to become ***analytic perceivers*** that can extract scientific insights from noisy uncurated data in the wild. 
I enable robots to become ***active perceivers*** that can collect necessary information from an initially unknown environment for diverse tasks. 
I do so by developing algorithms grounded in probability theory, information theory, and game theory. 

## Publications

## Projects
I have worked on a wide range of projects, including (1) <b>Mapping</b>: Semantic Gaussian Splatting, Large Scale NeRF, Active Visual SLAM, Stereo Visual SLAM; (2) <b>Navigation</b>: Bio-inspired Navigation; (3) <b>Learning</b>: Conformal Prediction, Robust Transfer Learning.

# Teaching
I aspire to be an educator who spreads knowledge and fosters curiosity, growth, and equality. Beyond my regular responsibilities of holding recitations and office hours, as well as creating and grading homework problems, I initiated several efforts to foster a vibrant and inclusive learning experience.
