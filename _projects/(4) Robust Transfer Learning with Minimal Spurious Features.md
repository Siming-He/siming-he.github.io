name: Towards Robust Transfer Learning - Preventing the Transfer of Spurious Features with Task Interpolation
tools: [Transfer Learning, Robustness]
description: We show that the transfer of spurious features can be largely prevented by a simple task interpolation-based transfer algorithm that requires no more target images nor epochs than canonical fine-tuning.
